            "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field encompassing many techniques, but at its core, AI systems work by:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Data Input and Representation:**  AI systems learn from data. This data can be anything from images and text to sensor readings and financial transactions.  The data needs to be represented in a way the AI can understand, often through numerical features or vectors. This process is called feature engineering or representation learning.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Learning Algorithm:** This is the \"brain\" of the AI.  The algorithm processes the input data and identifies patterns, relationships, and underlying structures.  Different AI techniques use different algorithms:\n",
            "\n",
            "    * **Machine Learning (ML):**  This is a subset of AI where systems learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on the data.  Key types include:\n",
            "        * **Supervised Learning:**  The algorithm is trained on labeled data (data with known inputs and outputs).  Examples include image classification (training on images labeled \"cat\" or \"dog\") and spam detection.\n",
            "        * **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data and tries to find structure or patterns on its own.  Examples include clustering similar data points and dimensionality reduction.\n",
            "        * **Reinforcement Learning:** The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones.  Examples include game playing (AlphaGo) and robotics.\n",
            "\n",
            "    * **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\").  These networks can learn complex patterns from large datasets and are particularly successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",
            "\n",
            "    * **Expert Systems:** These are rule-based systems that mimic the decision-making ability of a human expert.  They use a set of \"if-then\" rules to solve problems within a specific domain.  They're less common now, largely replaced by more flexible ML approaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Model Development and Training:**  The learning algorithm is used to build a model.  This model represents the learned patterns and relationships from the data.  The training process involves feeding the algorithm large amounts of data and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize errors and improve accuracy.  This is an iterative process involving evaluation and refinement.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Prediction and Inference:** Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions or inferences on new, unseen data.  For example, an image recognition model trained on thousands of images can classify a new image as a \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Evaluation and Refinement:** The performance of the AI system is constantly evaluated using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).  The model may be retrained or refined based on this evaluation to improve its performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "It's important to remember that AI is not a single technology, but rather a collection of techniques and approaches.  The specific methods used depend heavily on the problem being solved and the available data.  Many AI systems are also combined to create more complex and powerful systems.\n",
