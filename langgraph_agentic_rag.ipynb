            "AI doesn't work in a single, unified way.  Instead, it encompasses a broad range of techniques and approaches, all aiming to mimic aspects of human intelligence.  However, we can break down how many AI systems work into several key components:\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Data Collection and Preparation:**  This is the foundational step. AI systems, especially those based on machine learning, require massive amounts of data.  This data could be anything from images and text to sensor readings and financial transactions.  Crucially, this data needs to be cleaned, preprocessed, and formatted appropriately for the chosen AI algorithm. This might involve removing errors, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable representation (e.g., numerical vectors).\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Algorithm Selection:**  This involves choosing the appropriate algorithm or model based on the type of problem being solved and the nature of the data.  Some common algorithms include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from labeled data (data with known inputs and outputs).  Examples include:\n",
            "    * **Linear Regression:** Predicts a continuous output (e.g., house price).\n",
            "    * **Logistic Regression:** Predicts a categorical output (e.g., spam or not spam).\n",
            "    * **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):**  Effective for classification and regression tasks.\n",
            "    * **Decision Trees:**  Create a tree-like model to make predictions.\n",
            "    * **Neural Networks:**  Complex interconnected nodes that learn patterns in data (deep learning is a subset of this).\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, identifying patterns and structures without explicit guidance.  Examples include:\n",
            "    * **Clustering:** Groups similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).\n",
            "    * **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces the number of variables while preserving important information.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Reinforcement Learning:** The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.  This is commonly used in robotics and game playing.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Model Training:** This involves feeding the prepared data to the chosen algorithm. The algorithm adjusts its internal parameters to minimize errors and improve its ability to make accurate predictions or decisions.  This process can be computationally intensive, especially for complex models like deep neural networks, often requiring specialized hardware like GPUs.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Model Evaluation:**  Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics.  These metrics depend on the type of problem (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall for classification; mean squared error for regression).  This step helps determine if the model is performing well and identifies areas for improvement.\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Deployment and Monitoring:**  The trained model is then deployed to make predictions or decisions in a real-world setting. This could be integrated into a software application, a robotic system, or other platforms.  Continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure the model remains accurate and effective over time, as data distributions can change.  This may involve retraining the model periodically with new data.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Beyond these core steps:**  Different AI techniques exist, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Expert Systems:**  Rule-based systems that mimic the decision-making of human experts.\n",
            "* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Enables computers to understand and process human language.\n",
            "* **Computer Vision:**  Allows computers to \"see\" and interpret images and videos.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, AI works by combining data, algorithms, and computational power to build systems that can learn from data, make predictions, and solve problems in ways that mimic or surpass human capabilities in specific tasks.  The complexity and specifics vary greatly depending on the chosen approach and the problem being tackled.\n",

In prompting, a pre-trained language model is given a prompt (e.g. a natural language instruction) of a task and completes the response without any further training or gradient updates to its parameters... The ability to perform a task via few-shot prompting is emergent when a model has random performance until a certain scale, after which performance increases to well-above random'),\n",

              "  AIMessage(content=\"AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.\\n\\nAI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of weak AI. Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system with generalized human cognitive abilities. When presented with an unfamiliar task, a strong AI system is able to find a solution without human intervention.\\n\\nAI is used in a variety of fields, including medicine, finance, and manufacturing. In medicine, AI can be used to identify patterns in patients' medical records and make predictions about their health. In finance, AI can be used to detect and prevent fraud. In manufacturing, AI can be used to optimize production processes and improve efficiency.\\n\\nAI has the potential to greatly benefit society, but it also raises ethical and societal concerns. For example, AI systems could be used to make decisions that affect people's lives, such as whether or not they are hired for a job. It is important for AI systems to be transparent and for people to understand how they make decisions.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 296, 'prompt_tokens': 1267, 'total_tokens': 1563, 'completion_time': 0.45962352, 'prompt_time': 0.066908144, 'queue_time': 0.020104045, 'total_time': 0.526531664}, 'model_name': 'mixtral-8x7b-32768', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c5f20b5bb1', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d98c68d4-dbc0-4308-bd47-a6fbba04bf47-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1267, 'output_tokens': 296, 'total_tokens': 1563})]}"
